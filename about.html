    <h1>About CO APP</h1>

    <h2>Product Summary</h2>
    <p>
      CO is a platform designed for dancers to connect, grow, and showcase their talents. It serves as a digital hub where dancers can find inspiration, build their careers, and foster a positive lifestyle through movement. Unlike fleeting trends, this platform aims to establish a lasting impact in the dance community by providing opportunities for personal growth, collaboration, and professional exposure.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Will this platform become a lasting space for dancers, or will it fade as just another passing trend? Many talented dancers struggle to find consistent opportunities to grow their craft, gain exposure, and connect with like-minded individuals in a supportive environment. Without proper resources, dance often remains an underappreciated art form, especially in underserved communities. This is a non-organization run by a minority who focuses on uplifting people through dancing.
    </p>

    <h2>Goal Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal is to demonstrate that dance is a fun and powerful way to relieve stress, build community, and create opportunities. To support this vision, the app will include a charity and donation page to help fund events, organize tournaments, and hire multimedia professionals such as videographers and photographers to showcase dancers and their talents.
